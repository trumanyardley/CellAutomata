Purpose: Fun side project to help me learn about Cell Automata, Conway's game of life (RIP), Pygame, and get better at Python in general

How to run: python main.py

What are the buttons? 
-   The buttons represent 3 different groups of example patterns. There are stills which don't move, oscillators which...oscillate, and spaceships which can move. You can cycle through the examples in these groups by pressing r.

Controls:
-   ESC/quit button: close program
-   Backspace: clear canvas of all cells
-   r: switch between patterns on different cell groups
-   left-click: place outlined pattern down
